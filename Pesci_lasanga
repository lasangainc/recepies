Ingredients:

9 lasagna noodles
1 pound (450g) ricotta cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 can (14 ounces/400g) diced tomatoes
1 can (6 ounces/170g) tomato paste
1/2 cup water
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 pound (225g) cooked shrimp, peeled and deveined
1/2 pound (225g) cooked crabmeat
2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.

Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and beaten egg. Mix well and set aside.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent.

Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, water, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir well and simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.

In a separate bowl, combine the cooked shrimp and crabmeat.

To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them.

Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by half of the seafood mixture. Sprinkle a third of the shredded mozzarella cheese on top.

Repeat the layers with three more lasagna noodles, the remaining ricotta cheese mixture, the remaining seafood mixture, and another third of the mozzarella cheese.

Place the final layer of three lasagna noodles on top, followed by the remaining tomato sauce. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese on top.

Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.

Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving.

Enjoy your delicious pescatarian lasagna!
