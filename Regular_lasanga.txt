Ingredients:
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce
- 1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste
- 1 can (14.5 ounces) diced tomatoes
- 2 teaspoons dried basil
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 9 lasagna noodles
- 3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 1/2 cups ricotta cheese
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the meat is browned and the onion is translucent. Drain any excess fat.
3. Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, diced tomatoes, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Meanwhile, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
5. In a greased 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles on top, followed by a layer of mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of cheese on top.
6. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.
7. Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before serving.
