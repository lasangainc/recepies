Ingredients:

9 lasagna noodles
2 cups marinara sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium zucchini, thinly sliced
1 medium yellow squash, thinly sliced
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1 cup baby spinach
1 can (14 ounces/400g) crushed tomatoes
1 teaspoon dried basil
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 cups vegan ricotta cheese
1 cup vegan mozzarella cheese, shredded
Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)
Instructions:

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.

Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is soft and translucent.

Add the zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper, mushrooms, and baby spinach to the skillet. Cook for about 5 minutes until the vegetables are tender.

Stir in the crushed tomatoes, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.

In a bowl, combine the vegan ricotta cheese and shredded vegan mozzarella cheese. Mix well.

To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of marinara sauce on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them.

Spread half of the vegetable mixture over the noodles, followed by half of the vegan cheese mixture. Repeat the layers with three more lasagna noodles, the remaining vegetable mixture, and the remaining vegan cheese mixture.

Place the final layer of three lasagna noodles on top and spread the remaining marinara sauce over them.

Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the lasagna is heated through and the top is slightly browned.

Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.

Enjoy your delicious vegan lasagna!
